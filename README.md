# japanese-language-aid

Simple CLI tools written in Python for learning Japanese. An overview of the tools are as follows

## `syllables.py`

This script contains three functions that perform quizzes for the user.

An English to Japanese quiz. The idea with this one is you answer with pen and paper since asking an English speaking user with an English keyboard to input "ne" is fairly pointless as a learning exercise.

There are also functions that select random hiragana and katakana characters and ask the user to provide the equivalent romanji. Feedback is provided after each answer is the feedback parameter is provided as True.

## `vocabulary.py`

At the moment this is a simple verb quiz.

## `kanji.py`

A work in progress to test kanji knowledge.
